# Housing-Price-Prediction
Housing Price Prediction

This project was created as part of a technical interview assignment for Sigmoid.
It focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate housing prices based on a variety of input features. The workflow involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and feature selection.

Model Development: Training machine learning models for regression tasks.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²).

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
